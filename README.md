<h2>Step 2: Pre-Installation</h2>
The Magento front end relies heavily on caching to provide a faster experience to customer. This is a wonderful tool, but can wreak havoc during the installation process. To ensure that cache is not the cause of any problem, you'd better turn it off. This can be done from the admin console by navigating to the Cache Management page (System->Cache Management), selecting all caches, clicking "disable" from the drop-down menu, and submitting the change.
